Thanks for visiting my Github Data Project Portfolio!

My name is Jacky and I'm an MA in Econ graduate at McGill University. I am now seeking for data analyst, data scientist, and economic analyst graduate positions. 

My favorite topics for investigation are **demography (esp. immigration), labor market, health, and ESG**. I'm planning to work on more projects relating to ESG for my personal interest.

Please click on the my-projects file to view my projects. I divided my projects into 3 different types: Python, SQL & Tableau.

* For **Python** projects: I have already uploaded all the Jupyter Notebooks for my projects with all code executed, accompanied with explanations. You can directly view all the results of my codes.
* For **Tableau** projects: Please proceed to my Tableau public website for my Tableau interactive dashboards. The link is provided in the file.
* For **SQL** projects: Please proceed to the file for my SQL codes. For your reference, I'm using Microsoft SQL Server for my projects.
